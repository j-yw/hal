# ADR 0001: Hal Future Team and Organization Factory Control Plane

## Status

Proposed

## Related Issue

- [ReScienceLab/hal#16](https://github.com/ReScienceLab/hal/issues/16)

## Scope

This ADR is documentation-only. It records the intended architectural direction
for Hal's future team and organization factory control plane and does not
change runtime behavior, command behavior, storage formats, or machine-readable
CLI contracts.

## Context

Hal currently operates as a local CLI-driven factory workflow. Future work may
introduce shared coordination for teams and organizations, but that work needs a
stable architectural reference before implementation PRDs define concrete
runtime changes.

## Decision

Use this ADR as the canonical architectural reference for the future shared
factory control plane. The ADR will describe the current local boundary, CLI
contract compatibility expectations, control-plane domain model, authorization
boundaries, shared queue and run lifecycle, artifact and audit model, policy
precedence, migration strategy, and explicit non-goals.

## Consequences

- Future implementation PRDs can refer to this ADR for terminology and
  compatibility constraints.
- Current Hal runtime behavior remains unchanged by this document.
- Any future hosted or networked control-plane behavior must be introduced by
  separate implementation work with its own tests and contract updates.

## Topics To Define

The following sections will be expanded by subsequent stories:

- Current local execution boundary
- CLI machine contract boundary
- Control-plane domain model
- RBAC and authorization boundary
- Shared queue and run lifecycle
- Shared artifacts and audit logging
- Policy inheritance and overrides
- Migration strategy
- Non-goal guardrails
