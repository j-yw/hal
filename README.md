Autonomous AI coding loop CLI. Feed it a PRD, and it implements each user story one iteration at a time using AI coding agents.

> "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that... without a proper PRD."

## Features

- **PRD-driven development** — Generate, convert, and validate Product Requirements Documents
- **Autonomous execution** — Each iteration picks the next story, implements it, commits, and updates progress
- **Fresh context per iteration** — Every story gets a clean context window, no memory pollution
- **Pluggable engines** — Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or Pi
- **Project standards** — Codify patterns into standards that are injected into every agent iteration
- **Archive & restore** — Switch between features without losing state
- **Compound pipeline** — Full automation from analysis to pull request

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap j-yw/tap
brew install --cask hal
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j-yw/hal.git
cd hal
make install    # Installs to ~/.local/bin
```

### Requirements

- Go 1.25.7+ (for building from source)
- One of the following AI coding agents:
  - [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) CLI (default engine)
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
  - [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) CLI

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize project
hal init

# Generate a PRD interactively
hal plan "add user authentication"

# Convert markdown PRD to JSON (auto-picks .hal/prd-*.md)
hal convert

# Validate the PRD
hal validate

# Run the autonomous loop
hal run
```

## How It Works

### Manual Workflow

```
hal init → hal plan → hal convert → hal validate → hal run
```

1. **init** — Set up `.hal/` directory with config, templates, skills, and commands
2. **plan** — Generate a PRD through clarifying questions
3. **convert** — Transform markdown PRD to structured JSON (default no archive; use `--archive` / `--force` for guarded canonical overwrites)
4. **validate** — Check stories against quality rules
5. **run** — Loop through stories: pick next, implement, commit, repeat

### Compound Pipeline (Fully Automated)

```
hal report → hal auto → hal report → hal auto → ...
```

The compound pipeline creates a continuous development cycle:

1. **`hal report`** — Runs **legacy session reporting** (the behavior that previously lived under `hal review`). It analyzes completed work and generates a report with recommendations for next steps. Saves to `.hal/reports/` and updates `AGENTS.md` with discovered patterns.

2. **`hal auto`** — Reads the latest report, identifies the priority item, and runs the full pipeline:
   - **Analyze** → **Branch** → **PRD** → **Explode** → **Loop** → **PR**

3. **Repeat** — After the PR merges, run `hal report` again to generate the next report.

For iterative branch-vs-branch review/fix loops, use:

```bash
hal review --base <base-branch> [iterations]
hal review --base <base-branch> --iterations <n> -e codex
```

**Getting started:** Run the manual workflow first (`hal plan` → `hal run`), then `hal report` to generate your first report. Or place a report directly in `.hal/reports/`.

State is saved after each step — use `hal auto --resume` to continue from interruptions.

### Migration Note

The old `hal review` reporting workflow moved to `hal report`.

- Use `hal report` for legacy session reporting and report generation.
- Use `hal review --base <base-branch> [iterations]` for the new iterative review/fix loop (select engine with `-e`).
- `hal review against <base-branch> [iterations]` remains as a deprecated alias.
- `hal explode --branch <name>` is long-only (`-b` removed) and sets output PRD `branchName`.
- Deprecation timeline: deprecated in `v0.2.0`, removed in `v1.0.0`.

## CLI Reference

Generated CLI command reference docs are available in [`docs/cli/`](docs/cli/) with the main entry page at [`docs/cli/hal.md`](docs/cli/hal.md).

## Commands

### Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal init` | Initialize `.hal/` directory with config, skills, and commands |
| `hal plan [description]` | Generate PRD (opens editor if no args) |
| `hal convert [markdown-prd]` | Convert markdown PRD to JSON (auto-discover source when omitted) |
| `hal validate [prd.json]` | Validate PRD against quality rules |
| `hal run [iterations]` | Execute stories autonomously (default: 10; do not combine positional iterations with `-i/--iterations`) |

### Status & Health

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal status [--json]` | Show workflow state (manual, compound, review-loop) |
| `hal doctor [--json]` | Check environment health (engine-aware, detects broken links) |
| `hal continue [--json]` | Show what to do next (combines status + doctor) |

### Link Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal links status [--json]` | Inspect engine skill links (per-engine health) |
| `hal links refresh [engine]` | Recreate skill links for all or specific engine |

### Compound Pipeline

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal report` | Generate summary report → `.hal/reports/`, update AGENTS.md |
| `hal review --base <base-branch> [iterations]` | Iterative review/fix loop against a base branch (use `-e`; do not combine positional iterations with `-i/--iterations`) |
| `hal auto` | Run full pipeline using latest report |
| `hal analyze [report] --format text\|json` | Analyze a report to find priority item (`--output` is deprecated) |
| `hal explode <prd.md> --branch <name>` | Break PRD into 8-15 granular tasks and set output PRD `branchName` |

### Standards

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal standards list` | List configured standards with index |
| `hal standards discover` | Guide for discovering standards interactively |

### Archive Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal archive` | Archive current feature state (alias of `hal archive create`) |
| `hal archive create` | Archive current feature state explicitly |
| `hal archive list` | List all archived features (`--name/-n` is invalid here) |
| `hal archive restore <name>` | Restore an archived feature (`--name/-n` is invalid here) |

Archive contract details:
- `hal archive` is the create alias
- `--name/-n` is only valid for `hal archive` and `hal archive create`
- If no name is provided and stdin is non-interactive, the command fails and asks for `--name/-n`

### Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hal config` | Show current configuration |
| `hal config add-rule <name>` | Create a custom rule template (deprecated in v0.2.0, removed in v1.0.0; use standards workflow) |
| `hal cleanup` | Remove orphaned legacy files (supports `--dry-run`) |
| `hal version` | Show version information |

### Analyze Output Contract

```bash
hal analyze --format text
hal analyze --format json
hal analyze --output json   # deprecated in v0.2.0, removed in v1.0.0
```

`--output/-o` and `--format/-f` cannot be used together.

### Sandbox Template Workflow

hal uses one template snapshot contract:

- template snapshot name is fixed to `hal`
- template source is fixed to `sandbox/Dockerfile` with build context `.`
- `hal sandbox start [-n NAME]` always resolves snapshot `hal` (reuse if active, create if missing)

```bash
hal sandbox snapshot create      # create/reuse template snapshot "hal"
hal sandbox start -n my-box      # start sandbox from template snapshot "hal"
```

After changing `sandbox/Dockerfile`, refresh the template snapshot:

```bash
hal sandbox snapshot list
hal sandbox snapshot delete --id <hal-snapshot-id>
hal sandbox snapshot create
```

### Sandbox Name and Exec Passthrough

`--name/-n` is available on:
- `hal sandbox start`
- `hal sandbox status`
- `hal sandbox stop`
- `hal sandbox delete`
- `hal sandbox shell`
- `hal sandbox exec`

For remote commands that start with flags, use `--`:

```bash
hal sandbox exec -n my-sandbox -- npm test
hal sandbox exec -- -n foo      # passes '-n foo' to remote command unchanged
```

## Planning a Feature

### Editor Mode (Recommended)

```bash
hal plan
```

Opens your editor with a template. Write your feature spec, save, and quit. The AI will ask clarifying questions, then generate a complete PRD.

Editor resolution: `$EDITOR` → `$VISUAL` → `nano` → `vim` → `vi`

### Inline Mode

```bash
hal plan "add dark mode toggle to settings"
```

Good for quick, well-defined features.

### Output Formats

```bash
hal plan "notifications"                    # Outputs .hal/prd-notifications.md
hal plan "notifications" --format json      # Outputs .hal/prd.json directly
```

## Converting PRDs Safely

`hal convert` now defaults to a non-destructive workflow and makes stateful behavior explicit.

### Source Selection

- `hal convert` (no args) scans `.hal/prd-*.md`, picks the newest file by modified time, and uses lexicographic filename ascending as the tie-break when mtimes are equal.
- `hal convert <path>` uses the explicit path as-is (and fails early if the file does not exist).
- Once resolved, convert prints: `Using source: <path>`.

### Safety Controls

- Default convert **does not** archive existing feature state.
- `--archive` archives existing feature state before writing canonical `.hal/prd.json`.
- `--archive` is only supported when output is canonical `.hal/prd.json` (it is rejected with custom output paths).
- Canonical writes are protected from accidental branch switches. If existing and incoming `branchName` values differ, convert stops with:
  - `branch changed from <old> to <new>; run 'hal convert --archive' or 'hal archive' first, or use --force`
- Use `--force` to bypass that branch-mismatch guard without creating an archive.

### Convert Examples

```bash
# Default no-archive conversion (auto-select markdown source)
hal convert

# Explicit markdown source (still no archive unless requested)
hal convert .hal/prd-authentication.md

# Explicit archive flow before canonical overwrite
hal convert --archive

# Override canonical branch mismatch guard without archiving
hal convert .hal/prd-authentication.md --force

# Custom output path (archive disabled by design)
hal convert .hal/prd-authentication.md -o /tmp/prd.json
```

## Running the Loop

```bash
hal run                      # Run 10 iterations (default)
hal run 5                    # Run 5 iterations (positional)
hal run -i 5                 # Run 5 iterations (flag)
hal run 1 -s US-001          # Run a specific story
hal run --base develop       # Set base branch explicitly
hal run --timeout 30m        # Raise the per-session engine timeout
hal run --dry-run            # Preview without executing
hal run -e codex             # Use Codex engine
hal run -e pi                # Use Pi engine
```

`hal run [iterations]` and `hal run --iterations/-i <n>` are mutually exclusive.

Each iteration:
1. Reads `prd.json` and `progress.txt`
2. Loads project standards from `.hal/standards/` and injects them into the prompt
3. Picks highest-priority incomplete story
4. Spawns fresh engine instance
5. Implements the story
6. Commits changes
7. Updates `prd.json` (marks story complete)
8. Appends learnings to `progress.txt`

## Project Standards

Standards are concise, codebase-specific rules stored in `.hal/standards/` as markdown files. They are automatically injected into the agent prompt on every `hal run` iteration, ensuring consistent code quality and pattern adherence across all AI-driven work.

### How Standards Work

1. **`hal init`** creates `.hal/standards/` and installs discovery commands for all engines
2. Standards are `.md` files organized by domain (e.g., `config/`, `engine/`, `testing/`)
3. On every `hal run`, all `.md` files are loaded, concatenated, and injected into the `{{STANDARDS}}` placeholder in `prompt.md`
4. The agent sees them as "## Project Standards — You MUST follow these..."

### Discovering Standards

Standards discovery is interactive — it scans your codebase, identifies patterns, and walks through each one with you:

```bash
# See what's available
hal standards list

# Get instructions for your engine
hal standards discover
```

The discovery commands are installed for all engines during `hal init`:

| Engine | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Claude Code | `/hal/discover-standards` |
| Pi | `/hal/discover-standards` |
| Codex | Ask agent to read `.hal/commands/discover-standards.md` |

### Example Standard

```markdown
# Init Idempotency

`hal init` is safe to run repeatedly. It never destroys existing state.

## Rules

- **Directories**: Use `os.MkdirAll` — idempotent by design
- **Default files**: Only write if file doesn't exist (`os.Stat` check first)
- **Skills**: Reinstalled every init (embedded files overwrite installed copies)
- **Template migrations**: Run every init via `migrateTemplates` (idempotent patches)

## Never Overwrite User Files

User customizations to `config.yaml`, `prompt.md`, and `progress.txt` are sacred.
```

### Standards Index

An optional `index.yml` catalogs all standards with descriptions:

```yaml
config:
  init-idempotency:
    description: hal init never overwrites user files; uses MkdirAll and stat-before-write
  template-constants:
    description: All .hal/ paths defined in internal/template/template.go; never hardcode
engine:
  process-isolation:
    description: Setsid + process group kill for TTY detachment and orphan prevention
```

### Committing Standards

Standards and commands in `.hal/` are committed to git (not ignored), while runtime state (`config.yaml`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`) stays ignored. This means your team shares the same standards and discovery commands across all clones.

## PRD Format

```json
{
  "project": "MyProject",
  "branchName": "hal/feature-name",
  "description": "Feature description",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Add database schema",
      "description": "As a developer, I want the schema defined...",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Migration creates users table",
        "Typecheck passes"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Story Rules

- Each story completable in **one iteration** (one context window)
- Ordered by dependency: schema → backend → frontend
- Every story includes "Typecheck passes" criterion
- UI stories include browser verification criteria
- Acceptance criteria are verifiable, not vague

```

Engine-specific symlinks are created during `hal init`:
- `.claude/commands/hal` → `.hal/commands/`
- `.claude/skills/*` → `.hal/skills/*`
- `.pi/prompts/*.md` → `.hal/commands/*.md`
- `.pi/skills/*` → `.hal/skills/*`
- `~/.codex/commands/hal` → `.hal/commands/` (absolute)
- `~/.codex/skills/*` → `.hal/skills/*` (absolute)

## Configuration

Edit `.hal/config.yaml`:

```yaml
engine: codex               # or claude, pi
maxIterations: 10
retryDelay: 30s
maxRetries: 3

auto:
  reportsDir: .hal/reports
  branchPrefix: compound/
  maxIterations: 25

engines:
  codex:
    model: o3
    timeout: 30m
  pi:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    provider: openrouter
```

Use a higher `engines.codex.timeout` when Codex sessions do long reasoning or large edits. You can also override it ad hoc with `hal run --timeout 30m`.

> Note: `hal init` preserves existing `.hal/config.yaml` files. If your project was initialized earlier, it may still have `engine: claude`. Update it to `engine: codex` if you want codex as the default runtime engine.

Engine resolution order:
1. explicit `--engine` (if provided)
2. top-level `engine` in `.hal/config.yaml`
3. fallback to `codex`

If an explicit `--engine` is blank (for example `--engine "   "`), hal exits with a validation error.

## Engines

Hal supports multiple AI coding agents:

| Engine | CLI Command | Install |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Codex (default) | `codex` | [Codex repo](https://github.com/openai/codex) |
| Claude | `claude` | [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| Pi | `pi` | [Pi repo](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) |

Switch engines with `-e`:

```bash
hal run -e codex
hal run -e pi
```

## Development

```bash
make build       # Build binary with version metadata
make install     # Install to ~/.local/bin
make test        # Run tests
make vet         # Run go vet
make fmt         # Format code
make lint        # Run golangci-lint (if installed)
```

## Releases

Hal release tags are standardized to **`vX.Y.Z`** (for example, `v0.1.7`).

```bash
# one-time per clone: ensure git-flow tags include "v" prefix
git config gitflow.prefix.versiontag v

# create and finish a release branch
git flow release start 0.1.7
git flow release finish -p 0.1.7
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs tests and publishes artifacts via GoReleaser.
