# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `cmd/`: Cobra CLI commands and flags.
- `internal/`: core packages (`engine/`, `loop/`, `prd/`, `skills/`, `template/`).
- `main.go`: CLI entrypoint wiring.
- `agent-os/`: product/roadmap documentation.
- `.goralph/`: runtime config created by `goralph init` (`config.yaml`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, `prompt.md`, `skills/`, `archive/`, `reports/`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make build`: compile `goralph` with version metadata.
- `make install`: install to `~/.local/bin`.
- `make test`: run unit tests (`go test -v ./...`).
- `make vet`: run `go vet` checks.
- `make fmt`: format code with `go fmt` (gofmt).
- `make lint`: run `golangci-lint` if installed.
- `make run ARGS='--help'`: build and run with arguments.
- Integration tests: `go test -tags=integration ./internal/engine/codex/...` (requires the Codex CLI).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Go 1.25+ module; keep packages focused and files small.
- Use `gofmt`; indentation and alignment are formatter-controlled.
- File names are lowercase with underscores (e.g., `integration_test.go`).
- Exported identifiers use `CamelCase`; unexported use `camelCase`.
- Prefer explicit error handling and wrap with `%w` when propagating.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live alongside code as `*_test.go`.
- Favor table-driven tests for multiple cases.
- Integration tests are tagged `integration` and may skip when Codex CLI is missing.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid network or CLI dependencies outside tagged tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- Include PRD story IDs when applicable (e.g., `feat: US-008 - ...`).
- PRs should explain the change, link the PRD/issue, and list tests run (e.g., `make test`).
- Include screenshots only for CLI output or UX changes.
