# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `cmd/`: Cobra CLI commands and flags.
- `internal/`: core packages (`engine/`, `loop/`, `prd/`, `skills/`, `template/`).
- `main.go`: CLI entrypoint wiring.
- `agent-os/`: product/roadmap documentation.
- `.hal/`: runtime config created by `hal init` (`config.yaml`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, `prompt.md`, `skills/`, `archive/`, `reports/`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make build`: compile `hal` with version metadata.
- `make install`: install to `~/.local/bin`.
- `make test`: run unit tests (`go test -v ./...`).
- `make vet`: run `go vet` checks.
- `make fmt`: format code with `go fmt` (gofmt).
- `make lint`: run `golangci-lint` if installed.
- `make run ARGS='--help'`: build and run with arguments.
- Integration tests: `go test -tags=integration ./internal/engine/codex/...` (requires the Codex CLI).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Go 1.25+ module; keep packages focused and files small.
- Use `gofmt`; indentation and alignment are formatter-controlled.
- File names are lowercase with underscores (e.g., `integration_test.go`).
- Exported identifiers use `CamelCase`; unexported use `camelCase`.
- Prefer explicit error handling and wrap with `%w` when propagating.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live alongside code as `*_test.go`.
- Favor table-driven tests for multiple cases.
- Integration tests are tagged `integration` and may skip when Codex CLI is missing.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid network or CLI dependencies outside tagged tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- Include PRD story IDs when applicable (e.g., `feat: US-008 - ...`).
- PRs should explain the change, link the PRD/issue, and list tests run (e.g., `make test`).
- Include screenshots only for CLI output or UX changes.

## Patterns from hal/rename-to-hal (2026-02-04)

- For runtime directory renames, use template.HalDir in Go code but separately sweep hardcoded user-facing strings in cmd/* and prompt templates (e.g., config.go, explode.go) so paths like .hal stay consistent.
- Skill renames should use git mv for internal/skills directories, then update embed.go (//go:embed path, SkillContent keys, SkillNames) and adjust .gitignore to `/hal` so the binary is ignored without hiding skills/hal.
- Migration logic in cmd/init.go follows a safe existence-check flow: if legacy .goralph exists and .hal does not, rename; if both exist, warn and continue with .hal.
- Rename passes must include branch-prefix literals and test fixtures (e.g., ralph/ -> hal/) because they are not covered by import or constant changes.

## Patterns from compound/init-migration-tests (2026-02-04)

- To test Cobra RunE handlers, extract testable logic into standalone functions that accept an `io.Writer` for output capture (e.g., `migrateConfigDir(oldDir, newDir string, w io.Writer)`), then test the function directly with `bytes.Buffer`.
- To force `os.Rename` failure in tests, use `os.Chmod(dir, 0555)` on the parent directory to deny write permission; remember to restore with `t.Cleanup` so `t.TempDir()` cleanup succeeds.
- Migration logic in cmd/init.go is now in `migrateConfigDir` function with `migrateResult` enum — update this function when changing migration behavior.
