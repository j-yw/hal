I'll create a comprehensive PRD for the Compound Engineering Integration feature. Let me first explore the existing codebase to understand the current structure and patterns.Now let me also check the existing skills structure and the template package.Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me create the PRD for the Compound Engineering Integration feature.I've created the PRD at `.goralph/prd-compound-engineering.md`. 

The PRD contains 20 user stories ordered by dependency (types → config → templates → init updates → skills → PRD changes → analyze components → git helpers → pipeline → commands → tests → backward compatibility). Each story:

- Uses T-XXX IDs (as requested)
- Is small enough for one iteration
- Has verifiable acceptance criteria
- Includes "Typecheck passes" 
- Follows the schema → backend → frontend pattern where applicable

Key highlights:
- **T-001 to T-004:** Foundation (types, config, templates)
- **T-005 to T-008:** Skills and PRD format updates  
- **T-009 to T-012:** Analyze and explode commands
- **T-013 to T-017:** Pipeline implementation and auto command
- **T-018 to T-020:** Edge cases, tests, and backward compatibility
