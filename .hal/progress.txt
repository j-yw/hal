# Hal Progress

## Codebase Patterns
- progress.txt is the single source of truth for both manual and auto workflows (consolidated from separate files)
- When removing constants, also update all usages in tests to maintain compilation
- Archive feature state files are defined in internal/archive/archive.go featureStateFiles slice

## 2026-02-05 - US-001: Remove AutoProgressFile constant from template package
- Removed AutoProgressFile constant from internal/template/template.go
- Removed AutoProgressFile from DefaultFiles() map (hal init no longer creates auto-progress.txt)
- Updated internal/archive/archive.go to remove AutoProgressFile from featureStateFiles
- Updated internal/compound/pipeline.go to use ProgressFile instead of AutoProgressFile
- Updated internal/archive/archive_test.go to use ProgressFile instead of AutoProgressFile
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Removing a constant requires updating all usages including test files
  - The featureStateFiles slice defines which files are archived - update it when removing state files
  - Pipeline uses ProgressFile for loop config, not a separate auto file

## 2026-02-05 - US-003: Add migration logic for existing auto-progress.txt
- Added migrateAutoProgress() method to internal/compound/pipeline.go
- Migration runs before progress file initialization in runLoopStep()
- If auto-progress.txt exists and has content, it is merged into progress.txt:
  - If progress.txt is empty/default: auto-progress content replaces it
  - If both have content: auto-progress content is appended with separator
- Legacy auto-progress.txt is deleted after successful migration
- Migration is logged to display output
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Migration logic should handle edge cases: empty files, default content, missing files
  - Use os.IsNotExist() to distinguish "file not found" from other read errors
  - Template.DefaultProgress can be used to detect "unchanged default" state
